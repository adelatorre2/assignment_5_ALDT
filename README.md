# Assignment 5 – MT220-01: Introduction to Probability and Statistics

This repository contains the complete files and scripts for **Assignment 5** of the MT220-01 course at IES Abroad (Spring 2025), submitted by Alejandro De La Torre. The assignment explores statistical estimation techniques including confidence intervals, analytical probability evaluation, and exponential distribution modeling.

## 🧠 Assignment Topics
- Confidence intervals assuming known variance
- Normal distribution assumptions and inference
- Probability calculation from cumulative distributions
- Analytical determination of required sample size
- Exponential distribution properties (pdf, mean, variance)

## 🔧 How to Use

To reproduce the full analysis:

1. Open `assignment_5.R` in RStudio or VS Code.
2. Set the working directory to the root folder (`assignment_5_ALDT/`).
3. Run the script top-down to compute and print answers for Problems 1 through 5.
4. Visualizations and supporting output are saved into `report/figures/` and `report/tables/`.

To compile the written report:

1. Open `report/assignment_5_writeup.tex` in Overleaf or a local LaTeX editor.
2. Incorporate console output and plots from the R script.
3. Compile the document to a final PDF for submission.
