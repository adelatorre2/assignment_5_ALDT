\section*{Problem 1}

We are given a dataset of heights and weights for men and women. Assuming that these measurements follow a normal distribution and that the population variances are known and equal to the sample variances, we compute 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for each subgroup.

Let $\bar{x}$ be the sample mean, $\sigma^2$ the known variance (estimated using sample variance), and $n$ the sample size. The confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ under a normal distribution with known variance is given by:

\[
\left[ \bar{x} - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\ \bar{x} + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right]
\]

We use $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$ for a 95\% confidence level.

\subsection*{95\% Confidence Intervals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Men's Height: [63.65 cm, 66.91 cm]
  \item Women's Height: [63.63 cm, 67.84 cm]
  \item Men's Weight: [133.35 kg, 136.39 kg]
  \item Women's Weight: [135.33 kg, 136.93 kg]

\end{itemize}


\section*{Problem 2}

We are given that $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 5$ and variance $\sigma^2 = 1$.

\subsection*{a) PDF Expression}

The probability density function (pdf) of $X$ is:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x - 5)^2\right)
\]

Evaluating this at the mean:
\[
f(5) \approx 0.3989
\]

\subsection*{b) Probability that $X > 6$}

We compute this using the cumulative distribution function:
\[
P(X > 6) = 1 - P(X \leq 6) = 1 - \Phi(1) \approx 0.1587
\]

\subsection*{c) Probability that $3 < X < 6$}

\[
P(3 < X < 6) = \Phi(1) - \Phi(-2) \approx 0.8413 - 0.0228 = 0.8186
\]

\subsection*{d) Expected Value and Variance}

\[
\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu = 5, \quad \text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2 = 1
\]
